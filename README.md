# Verification Framework for Ethical Timber Sourcing
## Mano River Union Region (Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire)

### Purpose
This repository hosts the collaborative development of a transparent, multi‑stakeholder **Verification Framework for Ethical Timber Sourcing**. The goal is to establish clear, auditable standards that prevent “conflict timber” from entering supply chains, thereby removing economic incentives for illegal logging and promoting peace and stability in the Mano River Union region.

The framework is being drafted as a living document on GitHub, where every change is tracked and every stakeholder’s input is publicly recorded. This ensures transparency, accountability, and broad ownership of the final agreement.

### Stakeholders
The following groups are represented in the working group:

* **National Governments** – Forestry ministry officials from Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Côte d'Ivoire.
* **International NGOs** – Organizations focused on environmental protection, human rights, and transparency (e.g., Global Witness, WWF, Transparency International).
* **Local Community Groups** – Representatives of indigenous peoples, customary landowners, and forest‑dependent communities.
* **Timber Companies** – Both large international exporters and smaller local operators committed to ethical sourcing.

### Contribution Process
1. **Issues** – Each major section of the framework is discussed in a dedicated GitHub Issue. The issue describes what the section should cover and is assigned to the primary stakeholder group responsible for drafting the initial text.
2. **Branches** – The assigned stakeholder creates a new branch from `main`, writes their draft in the relevant section of `framework‑draft.md`, and submits a Pull Request (PR).
3. **Pull Request Review** – All stakeholders review the PR, using inline comments to suggest specific wording changes and the overall PR comment section to mediate broader disagreements. The project lead facilitates negotiation and seeks consensus.
4. **Merging** – Once a consensus is reached, the PR is merged into `main`.
5. **Releases** – When all sections are finalized, a formal GitHub Release (tagged `v1.0`) is created as the official, ratified version of the framework.

### Getting Started
* The current draft of the framework is in [`framework‑draft.md`](framework-draft.md).
* To propose changes, fork the repository, create a branch, edit the draft, and open a pull request.
* Please follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and be respectful of other stakeholders’ perspectives.

### Contact
For questions about the process, contact the project lead (a former rebel leader now working to reform the timber industry) via GitHub issues or discussions.

## 1. Chain of Custody
*To be drafted by timber companies and logistics experts.*

This section will define a traceability system that tracks timber from the stump (or point of harvest) through transportation, processing, export, and final sale. It will include requirements for digital documentation, unique identifiers, and periodic audits.

## 2. Community Land Rights and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)
*To be drafted by local community groups and indigenous representatives.*

This section will establish procedures for recognizing and respecting customary land rights, ensuring that any logging activity only proceeds after obtaining FPIC from affected communities. It will include templates for community‑led mapping and benefit‑sharing agreements.

## 3. Auditor Accreditation and Independent Verification
*To be drafted by international NGOs and accredited certification bodies.*

This section will set criteria for qualifying independent auditors, including requirements for impartiality, expertise, and adherence to internationally recognized auditing standards. It will define the process for periodic third‑party verification of compliance with the framework.

## 4. Prohibited Activities and Red Flags
*To be drafted by national governments and law‑enforcement agencies.*

This section will list activities that automatically disqualify timber from being considered ethical, such as logging in protected areas, use of forced labor, involvement of armed groups, falsification of documents, or bribery. It will also describe “red‑flag” indicators that trigger enhanced due diligence.

## 5. Stakeholder Consultation and Participation
*To be drafted by all stakeholder groups collectively.*

This section will outline how ongoing input from governments, NGOs, communities, and industry will be incorporated into future revisions of the framework. It will establish a standing multi‑stakeholder committee and define its decision‑making procedures.

## 6. Monitoring, Reporting, and Transparency
*To be drafted by national forestry ministries and transparency initiatives.*

This section will specify what data must be collected, how often it must be reported, and to which public registry it must be submitted. It will mandate the publication of concession maps, harvest volumes, tax payments, and audit results in open, machine‑readable formats.

## 7. Grievance Mechanism and Conflict Resolution
*To be drafted by human‑rights NGOs and community mediators.*

This section will create a accessible, confidential channel for anyone to report violations of the framework. It will describe steps for investigation, mediation, and, if necessary, referral to judicial authorities, with special protections for whistle‑blowers.

## 8. Certification Requirements and Labeling
*To be drafted by timber companies and certification schemes.*

This section will define the minimum criteria that a timber product must meet to carry an “Ethically Sourced – Mano River Union” label. It will also address how the label may be used in marketing and how it will be protected against misuse.

## 9. Enforcement and Sanctions
*To be drafted by national governments and regional bodies.*

This section will detail the legal and administrative penalties for non‑compliance, ranging from fines and suspension of operating licenses to criminal prosecution. It will also describe cross‑border cooperation to prevent banned operators from simply moving to a neighboring country.

## 10. Capacity Building and Technical Assistance
*To be drafted by development partners and training institutions.*

This section will identify the skills and resources needed by each stakeholder group to implement the framework effectively. It will propose training programs, funding mechanisms, and technology‑transfer initiatives to build long‑term local capacity.

## 11. Annexes
*To be drafted as needed.*

- Annex A: Glossary of Terms
- Annex B: Template for Chain‑of‑Custody Documents
- Annex C: FPIC Checklist and Consent Forms
- Annex D: Auditor Code of Conduct
- Annex E: List of Protected Species and Ecosystems
